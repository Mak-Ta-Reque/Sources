pulling an docker image:
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.04-tf2-py3

Seeing all the local images:
docker images

Run an image:
docker run -it --rm --name tensorflow2-container --network=h-it is used to open an interactive terminal
-it is used to open an interactive terminal
--rm is used so that when we exit the container, it will remove it
--name is used to name the container with a custom name
--network=host is used to have access to the Internet in the container (same network as the host machine)
Then, we have the name of the image to use followed by bash to create an interactive shell in the containerost nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.04-tf2-py3 bash


Checking the running containers:
doocker ps
